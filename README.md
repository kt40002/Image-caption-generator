# Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning
-  Integrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate
natural language descriptions for over 8,000 images, utilizing more than 40,000 captions from the Flickr8K image dataset
- Utilized the VGG16 model (pretrained on 1000000+ images from the ImageNet dataset) to extract high-level image features
- Achieved a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy-unigrams (BLEU-1) score of 0.526 and BLEU-2 (bigrams) score of 0.296
